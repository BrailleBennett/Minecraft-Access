# Minecraft Access

Minecraft Access is a [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net) mod that specifically helps visually impaired players play Minecraft.
It is an integration and replacement for [a series of previous mods](https://github.com/accessible-minecraft).
This mod primarily borrows the help of a screen reader to describe (narrate) the game interface, and incorporates sound cues to provide orientation perception in this 3D world.
Currently this mod [has enough features](doc/FAQ.md#is-the-mod-enough-to-play-the-game-normally) to help the visually impaired people play the game normally.
