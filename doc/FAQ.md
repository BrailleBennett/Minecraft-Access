# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is the mod enough to play the game normally?

Overall, the mod is enough for basic playing, but that doesn't mean you can play it as sighted player, for now at least.

We can claim that the current functionality of the mod is sufficient for normal play, given that users have already played with the help of this mod. Some of them are streaming so you can listen to the uploaded videos: [Logic Pro X Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/@LogicProXGaming/search?query=minecraft), [TrueBlindGaming](https://www.youtube.com/@TrueBlindGaming/search?query=minecraft).

The mod primarily borrows the help of a screen reader to describe the game interface, and incorporates sound cues to provide orientation perception in this 3D world.
Currently, the Mod has implemented such functions as `Read Crosshair` (read out blocks and creatures you're pointing at), 100% accessible of all screens, `Camera Controls` and `Mouse Simulation` with keyboard, `Points of Interest` (scan nearby special blocks and creatures and lock on them), and a new F4 `Narrator Manu` which contains assistant functions like "Read Light Level" "Find Closest Water Source".

You can play the game within keyboard's main typing part (which means a number pad isn't necessary), without a mouse. You can walk around the world, gather materials, farm the land, raise animals, mine, fight monsters, and even build buildings and redstone structures.

The "No" part of the answer contains two perspectives.

First, this mod does not achieve 100% accessibility.
For example, you'll find rowing the boat is difficult (since the relevant feature haven't been implemented yet), you can't directly recognize blocks that are placed together as a structure (since you can't see the entire appearance of a group of blocks, and there's very little this mod can do about that).
We're gradually adding new features, but I'm pessimistic that the Minecraft is too complex to ever achieve 100% accessibility.

Second, the Minecraft, despite the fact that it has a large number of players, is not easy to get started with. You'll need to learn many new concepts and knowledge to play it. You can learn how to play this game by listening the playing video (I recommend [Pixlriffs's Minecraft Survival Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfpHTJsn9I4&list=PLgENJ0iY3XBjmydGuzYTtDwfxuR6lN8KC)), reading [the wiki](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Minecraft_Wiki), or find someone skilled enough to teach you.

So if you haven't bought the game yet and don't know much about Minecraft, think again before paying.
