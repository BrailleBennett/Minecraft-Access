            When you're looking at a block and an entity, the mod will play a piano sound cue to indicate the relative location between you and the target.
            Volume to represent distance, the louder the sound the closer the distance.
            Pitch to represent altitude, the higher the pitch the higher the target is relative to you.
            You can turn off this feature or change sound volume in config.
