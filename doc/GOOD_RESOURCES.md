## Quality of Life Mods

Here are some mods that can improve your game experience.
There are guides about [installing](/doc/SET_UP_ON_WINDOWS.md#install-mods) and [upgrading](/doc/SET_UP_ON_WINDOWS.md#upgrade-the-game-and-mods) mods.

1. Client side, which you can use in both single-player and multiplayer game:
    * Presence Footsteps ([Fabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/presence-footsteps), [Forge port](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/presence-footsteps-forge)): Footstep sound enhancement mod. If the Fabric version of mod isn't work, select `Default sound pack` in the resource pack menu. If the mod has not supported your game version, you would consider to use this resource pack
      instead: [Presence Footsteps: Remastered Sounds Pack](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/presense-footsteps-sounds), put it under `%appdata%\.minecraft\resourcepacks` folder.
    * Just Enough Items ([Fabric and Forge](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei)): Item and recipe viewing mod, far better than similar recipe book feature in original game (but this mod hasn't been 100% accessible by us, you need some vision to use it).
    * Sound Physics Remastered ([Fabric and Forge](https://modrinth.com/mod/sound-physics-remastered)): Provides realistic sound attenuation, reverberation, and absorption through blocks. I'm sure this mod consumes resources, so install it only when you're confident in your PC hardware.

2. Server side, which you can only use in single-player game (unless the multiplayer server admins add them into the server):
    * Tree Harvester ([Fabric and Forge](https://modrinth.com/mod/tree-harvester)): Harvest trees and huge mushrooms instantly with an axe. It's a common scenario in Minecraft that you can't reach the logs and leaves at higher place when standing on the ground, with this mod, you won't bother yourself with stepping yourself up.
    * Carry On ([Fabric and Forge](https://modrinth.com/mod/carry-on)): Allowing players to pick up, carry, and place some blocks (such as Chests) and animals without breaking blocks or guiding animals with a leash.
    * FTB Ultimine ([Fabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ftb-ultimine-fabric), [Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ftb-ultimine-forge)): This mod can makes you operate on same type blocks around you by operating only once, like harvest crops, mining a vein and chopping trees.

Search on [Google](https://www.google.com), Minecraft has a long history since 2009 and there are many tutorials about it, almost every question already had been answered.
Ask AI, no kidding, platforms like [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) and [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) do know much about Minecraft since they are fed with amount of knowledge about it on Internet.

## A Very Simple Beginner Guide

Try reading [text tutorials for beginners on Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorials), if you find out that listening YouTube videos to learn to play this game is slow or difficult.
Because Minecraft's world generation is randomized, you may run into the difficulty of trying to generate multiple worlds but all of their spawn location are bad. You can search good [world generation seeds](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Seed_(level_generation)) [on Google](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=minecraft+good+seed) and set them when you're creating single player worlds.

I highly recommend you lower the difficulty of the game to get better experience, such as change the [difficulty](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Difficulty) to `Peaceful` to avoid monster spawning, or [use](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-commands) [commands](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Commands) to gain advantages (remember to turn on `Allow Cheats` option when you create the world).
Some commands are very convenient when you're playing single player worlds, such as ` /gamerule keepInventory true` to keep your inventory (highly recommended), `/tp` to teleport to another location, `/locate village` to find the nearest village, `/attribute @p minecraft:generic.max_health base set 1000` to make you take more damage so you can explore the game features freely, etc.
