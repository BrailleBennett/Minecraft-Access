# Set up on MacOS

This mod has been recently ported to MacOS, and all features should be supported. However, you must grant the accessibility permission to Minecraft for mouse simulation to work.

1. Launch Minecraft with the mod and enter a world
2. Press left bracket to trigger a mouse click
3. After you hear a message saying that the accessibility permission has not been granted, open System Settings
4. Choose Privacy & Security in the sidebar
5. Select Accessibility in the scroll area on the right
6. Find Minecraft (or your third-party launcher if you use one) in the list and turn it on
7. Enter your password when prompted
8. Restart Minecraft, and everything should work
